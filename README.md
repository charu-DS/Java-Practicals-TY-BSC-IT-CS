# Java-Practicals-TY-BSC-IT-CS
This repository contains few Enterprise Java Projects, developed in net beans.

Note: [Important]
I have added, html/jsp and java file in same folder. But when project will be created java file will be in src folder of your software, and html files in web folder by default.

Kindly change the class name in java file to the name of the file.
and kindly change the <form action="yourfilename" method="POST" > in html file.

For any queries please contact: lakshitasaraswat18@gmail.com
